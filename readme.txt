Provides a shortcode that outputs all levels a member is allowed to access.

== Description ==

Have you ever wanted a way to show all the content a member is allowed to access? This plugin gives you a simple shortcode that lists all the pages a user is allowed to access, grouped by level.

== Installation ==
1. Install the plugin
2. Use the shortcode `[wlm_all_authorized_levels]` to show all authorized levels for the logged-in user.
3. See the [FAQ](faq/) for more options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can I group pages by their level? =

Yes; use `[wlm_all_authorized_levels group_by_level="true"]` to group by pages by each level and (by default) show each level’s header.

= Can I hide the header? =

Yes; use `[wlm_all_authorized_levels show_header="false"]` to hide the header of each level (only works with `group_by_level`).

= Can I ignore specific pages? =

Yes; get the IDs of those pages from the WordPress admin page and then add them to the shortcode separated by commas, like this: `[wlm_all_authorized_levels pages_to_ignore="151,20"]`.

You can also use the `wlm_authorized_pages_array` filter to modify the array; see below for an example.

= Can I include specific pages? =

Yes, you can include specific pages using the `pages_to_include` attribute like this: `[wlm_all_authorized_levels pages_to_include="151,20"]`.

You can also use the `wlm_authorized_pages_array` filter to modify the array:

`
add_filter( 'wlm_authorized_pages_array', 'tweak_wlm_pages' );
function tweak_wlm_pages( $array ) {
    // add a page
    $array[] = $page_ID_to_add;

    // remove a page
    if ( $false !== ( $key = array_search( $page_ID_to_remove, $array ) ) ) {
        unset( $array[$key] );
    }

    // return the modified array
    return $array;
}
`

= Can I use a custom template? =

Not yet, but there are filters for every part of the output; here’s a list of the available filters:

- `wlm_all_levels_container_open`: wraps everything; defaults to `<div class="wishlist-member-levels">`
- `wlm_all_levels_container_close`: defaults to `</div>`
- `wlm_all_levels_level_wrapper_open`: wraps the entire list of items; defaults to `<ul>`
- `wlm_all_levels_level_wrapper_close`: defaults to `</ul>`
- `wlm_all_levels_item_wrapper_open`: wraps each item; defaults to `<li` (no closing bracket)
- `wlm_all_levels_item_wrapper_close`: defaults to `</li>`
- `wlm_all_levels_item_wrapper_class`: defaults to empty; space-separated list of classes to add to each item
- `wlm_all_levels_item_link`: defalts to `<a href="' . get_permalink() . '">' . get_the_title() . '</a>`; the post ID is available as a parameter to your callback function
- `wlm_no_authorized_levels_message`: defaults to `<p>Sorry, you are not authorized to access any content. Please check your subscription status or contact us for more information.</p>`; shown when a user is not authorized for any WishList levels
- `wlm_no_authorized_content_message`: defaults to `<p>Sorry, you are not authorized to access any content. Please check your subscription status or contact us for more information.</p>`; shown when there are no pages available
